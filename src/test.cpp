// the syntax for defining a test is below. It is important for the name to be unique, but you can group multiple tests with [tags]. A test can have [multiple][tags] using that syntax.
TEST_CASE("Example Test Name - Change me!", "[flag]"){
	// instantiate any class members that you need to test here
	int one = 1;

	// anything that evaluates to false in a REQUIRE block will result in a failing test 
	REQUIRE(one == 0);

	// all REQUIRE blocks must evaluate to true for the whole test to pass
	REQUIRE(false); // also fix me!
}

TEST_CASE("Test 2", "[flag]"){
	// you can also use "sections" to share setup code between tests, for example:
	int one = 1;

	SECTION("num is 2") {
		int num = one + 1;
		REQUIRE(num == 2);
	};

	SECTION("num is 3") {
		int num = one + 2;
		REQUIRE(num == 3);
	};

	// each section runs the setup code independently to ensure that they don't affect each other
}

// you must write 5 unique, meaningful tests for credit on the testing portion of this quiz!

// the provided tests from edugator are below. Note that you must determine the correct output for the [output_hidden] tests yourself
